            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am a proactive and deeply curious technology student with a strong drive to build practical, impactful
                solutions. My academic journey has led me to explore a diverse ranget of computer science fields. I have
                hands-on experience in full-stack development, building applications with technologies like Node.js,
                Express, and Flutter.

                Beyond web and mobile development, I am actively engaged with more specialized domains. I have a keen
                interest in machine learning (exploring models from linear regression to gradient boosting) and computer
                vision (working with the OpenCV library). I also pursue advanced topics like quantum computing with
                Qiskit and low-level systems programming in C, including memory management and socket programming.

                A significant passion of mine is cybersecurity, where I regularly participate in 'Capture The Flag'
                (CTF) challenges, honing my skills in reverse engineering and digital forensics.

                I thrive on applying this knowledge to real-world problems. I have collaborated with a team of six on a
                project for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), developed a 'Uniguide' application to help students with
                study abroad applications, and even architected a timetable generator using genetic algorithms. I also
                value giving back to the community, suchas by volunteering to teach children in slums about potential
                career options in technology. I am constantly seeking new challenges and am eager to leverage my broad
                technical skill set to solve complex problems.</p>

                <p>During the start of lockdown there was a state wide competition in punjab ambassador of hope in which
                    we have to create something to give hope to people around us.
                </p>
                <p>I designed this website which showed covid cases,news through api and it had a checker feature which
                    detected the risk by asking the Symptoms of the user.
                </p>
                <p>And surprisingly I secured second prize in the competition winning a laptop.

                <p>This app was created for my grandma and later on I published this application on playstore but now
                    it’s removed from play store because I didn’t accept new policies from play store as at that time I
                    was preparing for JEE.

                </p>
                <p>This app hosted prayers online on firebase and user can download the file and save it on there phone,
                    it had an inbuilt lyrics shower which showed live lyrics with the audio.(at that time there was not
                    such any third party plugin in flutter which can take in .lrc file and sync it with list view so I
                    created one but I never made the it as an library.)</p>

                <p>This application was developed using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language, making
                    it a cross-platform solution that can run on both iOS and Android from a single set of code. For its
                    mapping features, it integrates the flutter_map library, which allows it to display interactive
                    maps, possibly using OpenStreetMap data. The app also includes a built-in PDF reader by using the
                    pdfx library, which provides the convenience of viewing documents directly within the app without
                    needing another program. To provide a conversational experience, it connects to a third-party
                    service called Botpress, which powers the app's chatbot by managing the artificial intelligence and
                    natural language processing.</p>
